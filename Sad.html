  <h2>Name the Why</h2>
  <p>Sometimes, it is hard to rationalize our overwhelming feelings. The first step is to find the why. Depending on
    your circumstances, this could be easy or hard to think of. In the text field below, type in a phrase that
    communicates your "why".</p>
  <div id="containerAngry">
    <input type="text" class="input" id="sadInput">
    <button onclick="sad()" id="breathingCircleButton">Submit</button>
    <button onclick="document.getElementById('sadInput').value = ''; document.getElementById('sad').innerHTML = '';"
      id="breathingCircleButton">Clear
      input field</button>
  </div>

  <p id="sad"></p>
  <script>
    function sad() {
      document.getElementById("sad").innerHTML = "I'm sorry you're going through this. That really sucks. Sending you hugs!";
    }
  </script>

  <h2>Dance</h2>
  <p>Another way to relieve sadness is to literally shake it off with your favorite music. Of course, this method won't
    work for everyone and your feel-good music may be different than others in terms of rhythm, tone, and mood. Find
    whatever works best for you!</p>
  <p></p>

  <h2>Belly Breathes</h2>
  <div style="padding-bottom: 5em;">
    <a href="four-four-four.html"><button id="breathingCircleButton">Click here to follow along with breathing circle!</button></a>
  </div>
  <br>
  <p>Another strategy you can try is belly breathing (also known as diaphragmatic breathing) which allows for full
    oxygen exchange. Here's a list of steps according to <a id="source"
      href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/learning-diaphragmatic-breathing">Harvard Health
      Publishing</a>:<br>
  <ul>
    <li>Lie on your back on a flat surface (or in bed) with your knees bent. You can use a pillow under your head and
      your knees for support, if that's more comfortable.</li>
    <li>Place one hand on your upper chest and the other on your belly, just below your rib cage.</li>
    <li>Breathe in slowly through your nose, letting the air in deeply, towards your lower belly. The hand on your chest
      should remain still, while the one on your belly should rise.</li>
    <li>Tighten your abdominal muscles and let them fall inward as you exhale through pursed lips. The hand on your
      belly should move down to its original position</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>You can also practice this sitting in a chair, with your knees bent and your shoulders, head, and neck relaxed.</p>
