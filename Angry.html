  <h2>Find the Trigger</h2>
  <p class="angryText">Sometimes, it is hard to rationalize our overwhelming feelings. The first step is to find your
    trigger. Depending on your circumstances, this could be easy or hard to think of. In the text field below, type in a
    phrase that
    communicates your "trigger". Journaling has also been shown to improve well-being.</p>
  <div id="containerAngry">
    <input type="text" class="input" id="angryInput">
    <button onclick="angry()" id="breathingCircleButton">Submit</button>
    <button onclick="document.getElementById('angryInput').value = ''; document.getElementById('angry').innerHTML = '';" id="breathingCircleButton">Clear
      input field</button>
  </div>

  <p id="angry"></p>
  <script>
    function angry() {
      document.getElementById("angry").innerHTML = "I understand. You have every right to feel the way you do and it's frustrating.";
    }
  </script>

  <h2>Belly Breathes</h2>

  </div>
  <br>
  <p>Another strategy you can try is belly breathing (also known as diaphragmatic breathing) which allows for full
    oxygen exchange. Here's a list of steps according to <a id="source"
      href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/learning-diaphragmatic-breathing">Harvard Health
      Publishing</a>:<br>
  <ul>
    <li>Lie on your back on a flat surface (or in bed) with your knees bent. You can use a pillow under your head and
      your knees for support, if that's more comfortable.</li>
    <li>Place one hand on your upper chest and the other on your belly, just below your rib cage.</li>
    <li>Breathe in slowly through your nose, letting the air in deeply, towards your lower belly. The hand on your chest
      should remain still, while the one on your belly should rise.</li>
    <li>Tighten your abdominal muscles and let them fall inward as you exhale through pursed lips. The hand on your
      belly should move down to its original position</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>You can also practice this sitting in a chair, with your knees bent and your shoulders, head, and neck relaxed.</p>

  <h2 style="white-space: wrap;" id="prm">Progressive Muscle Relaxation</h2>
  <div style="padding-bottom: 5em;">
    <a href="four-four-four.html"><button id="breathingCircleButton">Click here to follow along with breathing circle!</button></a>
  </div>
  <br>
  <p>In a nutshell, PRM is the act of tensing one muscle group at a time followed by a relaxation phase with release of
    the tension, according to <a id="source"
      href="https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/muscle-relaxation-for-stress-insomnia">WebMD</a>. Here are some steps
    you can try: <br>
  <ul>
    <li>While inhaling, contract one muscle group (for example your upper thighs) for 5 seconds to 10 seconds, then
      exhale and suddenly release the tension in that muscle group.</li>
    <li>Give yourself 10 seconds to 20 seconds to relax, and then move on to the next muscle group (for example your
      buttocks).</li>
    <li>While releasing the tension, try to focus on the changes you feel when the muscle group is relaxed. Imagery may
      be helpful in conjunction with the release of tension, such as imagining that stressful feelings are flowing out
      of your body as you relax each muscle group.</li>
    <li>Gradually work your way up the body contracting and relaxing muscle groups.</li>
  </ul>
