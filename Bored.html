  <h2>Find a Passion</h2>
  <p>If you find yourself with nothing engaging to do, you can invest yourself in a new passion. Whether it is artistic, problem-solving, or creative, there are many activites you can chose to try out. Here's a list of example hobbies (note that there's way more than this list!): <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Collecting (coins, stamps, flowers, leaves, etc)</li>
      <li>Art (Drawing, painting, crocheting, sculpting, coloring, origami, etc)</li>
      <li>Problem-Solving (puzzles, board games, coding, robotics, etc)</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>Exercise</h2>
  <p>Exercise has consistently shown multiple health benefits. From taking a brisk walk outside, quick run on a treadmill, or a full HIIT workout, there are a variety of exercise options to chose from! Note that you don't have to exercise for long periods of time; whatever works with you and your schedule!</p>

  <h2>Go Outside and Follow Your Curiosity</h2>
  <p>Sometimes our curiosity needs stimulating. One way to achieve this is to go outside and take a moment to observe your surroundings. What do you smell? What do you hear? What do you hear?</p>

  <h2>Try to Decrease Screen Time</h2>
  <p>In general, doom scrolling through the Internet and social media has been shown to create negative effects in terms of well-being. Instead, try to engage in an alternative activity whether that is talking with family and friends or any of the mentioned methods above.</p>
