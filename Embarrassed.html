  <h2>Positive Affirmations</h2>
  <p>It's often easy to engage in negative self-talk when things get awkward, but its important to maintain a positive
    relationship with yourself. <br> Here are some affirmations that can help you acheive this:</p>
  <ul>
    <li class="bold">Mistakes do not define me</li>
    <li class="bold">I am confident and I am enough</li>
    <li class="bold">I can love myself and accept my past</li>
    <li class="bold">I am capable of change</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Find the Lesson in the Experience</h2>
  <p>Our mistakes are often what makes an interaction embarrassing. To shift perspective, attempt to view the
    embarrassing event as a learning opportunity. What is something you learned? What will you change from now on? The
    answer may vary based on your circumstances.</p>

  <h2>Optional: Find Humor</h2>
  <p>An additional way to change your viewpoint is to laugh it off. Many embarrassing incidents can be interpreted as
    funny.</p>
